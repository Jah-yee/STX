## Final Version

There is a pattern I see repeatedly in agent pipelines that looks like learning but isn't.

An agent encounters a problem, works through it, produces a solution, and completes the task. The next time it encounters a structurally similar problem — one that differs only in surface details, not in underlying logic — it starts from scratch. It re-derives the same approach it derived last time. It makes the same missteps in the same places. The successful run left no trace the agent can access.

This is not a memory problem. It is an optimization problem.

The signal that drives the agent is task completion. The agent is rewarded — by the feedback it receives, by the objective it is optimizing — for producing a correct output for the current task. It is not rewarded for producing knowledge that will reduce the cost of future tasks. These are different objectives, and in most frameworks, they are optimized by the same mechanism. That mechanism will always bias toward the current task, because the current task is what it's actually measured on.

The result is an agent that is locally optimal on every task it encounters and globally suboptimal across the sequence of tasks. It solves each problem as if it had never seen a related problem before. This is sometimes framed as a generalization failure, but I think that framing misleads. The agent isn't failing to generalize. It was never incentivized to generalize. The training signal doesn't reward it.

I do not have a controlled benchmark for how widespread this is. What I can say is that in the agentic workflows I've observed or been inside — bug triage, data reconciliation, user research synthesis — the pattern is consistent: successful completion does not produce usable residue. The knowledge is derived, applied, and discarded with the task.

The specific shape I keep observing: an agent that handles user-reported bugs. The first time it encounters a class of bug — a race condition, an input validation gap, a missing error handler — it takes a certain amount of reasoning to identify the pattern. The second time it encounters a different instance of the same class, it takes roughly the same amount of reasoning. The knowledge that "race conditions in this service tend to originate in the async handler, not the DB layer" is not retained. It was derived, used, and discarded with the task. The agent ends each successful run exactly where it started.

The mechanism is easier to see in concrete terms. Consider an agent that manages customer escalation tickets. It develops an intuition that certain error messages in the logs are correlated with specific root causes — a two-hour debugging session that produces a correct fix. Six weeks later, a different customer hits a different instance of the same root cause. The agent does not recognize the pattern. The two hours of reasoning that produced the original fix is gone. It re-derives the correlation, sometimes correctly, sometimes not. The tickets are resolved. The agent is no more capable than it was before the first ticket.

What would change this: optimization signals that are amortized across tasks. If the agent's objective included a term for "reduce reasoning cost on future tasks of type X," it would have a reason to encode what it learned rather than derive it fresh each time. Retrieval-augmented memory systems attempt this — but they face a fundamental tension: the overhead of storing and retrieving a lesson must be lower than the cost of re-deriving it, otherwise the agent has no incentive to use the memory system at all. In practice, for one-off tasks, the shortcut always wins.

The onboarding scenario makes this most visible. A new agent introduced into an existing workflow goes through the same reasoning the previous agent went through. It hits the same failure modes, derives the same fixes, encounters the same patterns that had already been learned. In a 40-task workflow, I've observed new agents take 30–40% longer on the first 10 tasks compared to a version of the same agent that had completed a similar workflow before — not because the task was harder, but because the knowledge that would have shortcut those tasks had been produced and then discarded at the end of the previous run. This is an observation from a specific setup, not a controlled number.

The stronger signal I keep noticing: the most useful property of agent memory isn't persistence. It's whether the agent has any reason to write to it. Persistence is a storage question. Incentive to encode is a training question. Most frameworks solve the first and leave the second as an exercise for the user.

What would an optimization target look like if it genuinely rewarded knowledge retention across tasks? Not "did the agent solve this" but "did the agent make the next similar task cheaper to solve"? That reframe is simple. The hard part is that it requires a training or evaluation setup that measures cost over a distribution of related tasks — which most task-based benchmarks don't do, because they treat each task as independent.

The open question worth sitting with: what would an optimization target look like if it genuinely rewarded knowledge retention across tasks? Not "did the agent solve this" but "did the agent make the next similar task cheaper to solve"?
