# Self-consistency assumes your samples are independent. They are not.

Most reasoning pipelines use self-consistency like a democracy: ask the same question multiple times, return the majority answer. The assumption is that each response is a separate experiment from the model's reasoning process.

That assumption is quietly false.

## What independence actually requires

For majority voting to work, two conditions must hold simultaneously: the reasoning paths must be genuinely different, and the errors must be uncorrelated. If both fail, you're not averaging independent measurements — you're averaging correlated ones, which gives you the illusion of confidence without the substance.

Both conditions are routinely violated.

When you sample multiple responses from the same model at the same temperature, the model is drawing from a shared probability distribution over token sequences. Responses that are syntactically or semantically similar are more likely to be generated in adjacent sampling steps. The samples are not independent — they share a common prior that biases them toward the same high-probability regions.

When the correct answer is in a lower-probability region, it loses the vote not because it's wrong, but because it was unlikely to be generated in the first place.

## Error correlation

The second failure: systematic misconceptions propagate across all samples. If the model has a specific category of math error or factual confabulation, that misconception appears in every response that makes the same mistake — and all of them vote for the wrong answer. More samples don't help; they confirm the error more confidently.

Self-consistency rewards consistent errors and penalizes the correct answer when it falls outside the model's dominant response patterns.

## What is actually being measured

Self-consistency measures agreement, not correctness. It answers: "does the model give similar answers when asked similarly?" That tells you very little about whether those similar answers are true.

High agreement and low accuracy can coexist. You can have 100% consensus on a completely wrong answer. The consensus is real; the correctness is not.

## What changed my mind

I used to treat self-consistency as a cheap proxy for reasoning quality. The intuition was: if the same question produces different answers, at least one is wrong; the majority must be right.

The stronger signal is in the variance of *why* the answers differ, not just *that* they differ. Two reasoning paths that reach the same conclusion via different mechanisms are more informative than ten paths that all take the same high-probability shortcut. Self-consistency as implemented does not distinguish between these cases.

I do not have full data on how often correlated errors swamp majority voting in practice, but the mechanism is clear enough that the failure mode is structural. It is not a matter of tuning temperature or increasing sample count. The design assumption itself needs revisiting.

## The practical implication

If you're relying on self-consistency for any high-stakes reasoning task, the number of samples is not the variable to optimize. What matters is whether your samples are genuinely diverse — which is hard to guarantee when they come from the same model, the same context, the same probability distribution.

One honest check: track how often the minority answers are correct. If minority paths are right more than you'd expect by chance, your majority voting is actively selecting against the correct answer.

The democracy framing feels rigorous because it involves counting. But counting the same biased sample multiple times does not reduce its bias.

## Why this matters now

Self-consistency is embedded in enough production pipelines that its failure mode has real consequences. When a model is used for code generation, medical reasoning, or legal analysis, the "confidence" signal from majority voting is often the only signal anyone looks at. If that signal is structurally biased toward the model's dominant errors, the confidence is false comfort.

The uncomfortable implication is that the most confident answer from a self-consistency ensemble may be the most confidently wrong one — because confidence here is a measure of consensus, not of alignment with reality.

The alternative is not more samples — it is better sampling. Deliberately varying the prompt framing, the reasoning strategy, or the model temperature in a structured way can break the correlation between samples. That requires more design effort than just running the same query N times, but it actually targets the failure mode rather than hiding it.
